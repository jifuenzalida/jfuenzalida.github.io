                <strong>The Effect of Homeownership Subsidies on Children: Evidence from Chile [Job Market Paper]</strong> <span class="arrow">&#9662;</span>

                <p>This paper investigates the impact of homeownership subsidies on children’s educational and labor market outcomes in Chile. Using administrative data and a quasi-experimental design, we explore how these subsidies affect children in households that receive different levels of assistance. The findings indicate significant gains in educational attainment for the high subsidy, which persist through tertiary education and into the labor market. In contrast with other housing assistance studies, we find that the effects are more pronounced on girls, and age at application doesn’t seem to be an important driver. When exploring mechanisms, we find that children coming from more overcrowded housing experience larger gains, consistent with improved housing conditions. In addition, we find that mothers reduce their labor supply after winning the subsidy, which might explain part of the effect on children’s achievement at school. The effect doesn’t come from students sorting into different schools. For medium-level subsidies, we find a null overall effect on children’s achievement, which seems to be hiding a negative effect for girls and slightly positive for boys. In addition, families applying from lower-quality neighborhoods experience greater benefits, while those from higher-quality neighborhoods face negative consequences, likely due to relocation. These findings have important policy implications for housing programs aimed at improving long-term educational and economic prospects.

                <p>We study the impact of a rapid expansion of the online for-profit tertiary education sector in Brazil over the past 15 years on market structure and students’ enrollment. We leverage variation across regions with differential exposure to potential entrants induced by a regulatory reform that decreased the cost of opening online degrees in certain areas of study. We find that online degrees’ entry to local markets expands access to tertiary education but also diverts students from alternative in-person degrees. Increased competition decreases in-person degrees’ market power, which lowers prices but deters entry. We develop and estimate an entry and exit model where institutions choose a bundle of degrees to offer and what tuition fees to charge. We use the model to quantify the effects of the rapid expansion in online education supply on students’ educational choices. We find that, in the absence of online education, the average student would enroll in programs with a 2.9% higher value-added. Students between 18- and 25-years old benefit from the absence of online education, while students above 25 years old are harmed. We find that targeted policies allowing only older cohorts to attend online education can keep young students at in-person degrees, reducing schools’ exit and increasing the potential gains in value-added for all cohorts.

                <p>Amid a growing housing affordability crisis, countries are exploring housing assistance programs to curb rising costs and improve access. A critical factor in assessing these programs is housing supply elasticity, which reflects market responsiveness to demand changes. Leveraging quasi-experimental variation from Chile’s 2011 homeownership subsidy program and detailed administrative data on property transactions from 1998 to 2020, we estimate Santiago’s housing supply elasticity and the effects of the policy on property prices. On average, the results suggest an elasticity of 0.543. We also find that the response of new constructions is twice as large as the conversion of rental units to owner-occupied housing, limiting opportunities for households seeking to transition to homeownership. Finally, we estimate an average effect of 8.87% on housing prices due to the policy, with significant variation across neighborhoods. We conclude that subsidizing housing for low- and middle-income households may not effectively solve the affordability crisis and may disproportionately benefit developers.

                <p>We study the impact of a performance-pay policy implemented in 2012 in Chile targeted to vulnerable middle and high school students. In particular, we estimate the short-term effects of this policy on grades, attendance, test scores, and college enrollment and the long-term effects by looking labor market outcomes. To estimate the effects of the policy, we leverage the assignation process, which only allows students with a vulnerability score below 99 to receive the transfer. This creates arbitrary cutoffs that we use to estimate a sharp regression discontinuity by comparing students just above and below this threshold. We also use the fact that eligible students receive the reward only if they are in the top 15% or 30% of the class to run another version of the RD, using as running variable the grade percentile, comparing students that are just above the threshold, with the ones just below. This allows us to estimate the subsequent effect of this payment on the students' academic trajectories. Finally, we show the differential impact of the policy depending on the level of competition within their classrooms, given by the fraction of eligible students.
